## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This project analyzes Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data to estimate wind directions, particularly focusing on cloud-covered regions. The implementation combines computer vision techniques with meteorological data processing to identify cloud patterns and calculate temperature gradients for wind direction prediction.

## Features<a name="features"></a>
- üå•Ô∏è Cloud detection using adaptive thresholding and morphological operations
- üå°Ô∏è Temperature gradient calculation with Sobel filters
- üß≠ Wind direction approximation based on gradient vectors
- üìä Visualization of results with directional arrows
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Focused analysis on cloud-affected regions

## Data Collection Process<a name="data-collection-process"></a>
To gather relevant satellite imagery and environmental data, the following tools and software were used:

1. **Orbitron** - A satellite tracking software that provides real-time tracking of various satellites to predict their visibility and communication windows.
2. **AirSharp SDR** - A software-defined radio (SDR) tool used to receive raw satellite signals, which are then decoded to obtain useful meteorological data.
3. **WXtoImg** - A widely used software for decoding NOAA APT (Automatic Picture Transmission) signals to generate SST images.
4. **NOAA Weather Satellites** - These satellites provide high-resolution thermal imaging data for SST analysis.
5. **Python with OpenCV and NumPy** - Used for processing and analyzing SST images.

## Implementation<a name="implementation"></a>
The THAPSAT project follows these steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: SST data is collected using satellite sources and SDR tools.
2. **Preprocessing**: The images are converted to grayscale and enhanced using Gaussian blurring.
3. **Cloud Detection**: Adaptive thresholding and morphological operations are applied to segment cloud regions.
4. **Gradient Computation (Sobel Filter)**:
   - The Sobel filter is used to calculate the temperature gradient in the SST image.
   - It helps to find the edges and contours in the image.
5. **Wind Direction Estimation (Direction Approximation)**:
   - The code calculates the magnitude and angle of the gradient vectors.
   - The angle in radians is converted to degrees and shifted to the range of [0, 360].
   - The adjusted wind direction thresholds are used to approximate the wind directions based on the gradient angles.
6. **Visualization**:
   - **Thresholding**: After calculating the gradient, a threshold is applied to segment the cloud region from the SST image.
   - Thresholding separates image pixels into two classes based on intensity values, helping to identify cloud regions.
   - Finally, the wind directions are visualized on the SST image using arrowed lines, highlighting the wind direction for each pixel in the cloud region.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The analysis produces SST images with cloud-detected regions and directional arrows indicating wind movement. These results aid in better understanding atmospheric dynamics and weather forecasting.
